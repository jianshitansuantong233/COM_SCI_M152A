The course is about digital system design. The project I uploaded is the implementation of a stopwatch.

All four source files are my own work.

Details about the project can be found at the pdf file in this repository.

A simple description about four source files: experiment.v is the master module; it also contains the state machine of adjust mode and a clock divider. Basic_clock contains the state machine of four numbers(two for minutes, two for seconds). Pause implements the pause function. Adjustment implements the adjustment function partially, the remaining part is in basic_clock. 

More comments will be added in source files.
